# Determining the maximum for a function
**Project developed in Python, using using a genetic algorithm**

## Input data
* population size;
* domain of the function;
* parameters for the maximize function;
* the accuracy with which the interval is discretized;
* probability of recombination;
* probability of mutation;
* number of steps of the algorithm;

## Algorithm steps
1. Creation of the initial population: the population consists of chromosomes of length [![Formula-lungime.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/76gwDRg8/Formula-lungime.gif)](https://postimg.cc/vgHpt3q3), with genes equal to 1 or 0
